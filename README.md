# Agora

A decentralized event platform built on Nostr.

Decentralized. Permissionless. Unstoppable.

## Overview

Agora is a censorship-resistant social network designed to empower freedom of association, speech, and exchange. It is built on the Nostr protocol, ensuring that the events and communities you create can never be deplatformed or taken down.

## Core Principles

*   **Decentralized:** There is no central server or company controlling the network. Your data is replicated across a resilient, distributed network.
*   **Permissionless:** Anyone, anywhere can create an event or a community without asking for permission or fitting within corporate guidelines.
*   **Unstoppable:** By leveraging the Nostr protocol, Agora is fundamentally resistant to censorship and takedowns.

## Key Features

*   **Uncancellable Events:** Create events with confidence that they cannot be removed or censored by a central authority.
*   **Censorship-Proof Communities:** Build and manage communities that you truly own.
*   **Nostr Native:** Built from the ground up on Nostr, leveraging its simplicity and power for decentralized identity and social graphs.
*   **Open Source:** The project is fully open source, allowing for transparency and community contributions.

## Getting Started

> **Note:** This project is currently in active development. For the latest setup instructions, please refer to the [Development Guide](./DEVELOPMENT.md).

### Prerequisites

*   Node.js (v18 or higher)
*   npm or yarn
*   An Android device or emulator for testing

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/agora.git
    cd agora
    ```

2.  Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

## How It Works

Agora uses Nostr events as the data layer for all platform activity. User profiles, event details, and community posts are all signed and published to the Nostr relay network, making them immutable and globally accessible without a central point of failure.
